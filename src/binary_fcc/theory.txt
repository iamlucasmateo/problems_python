K-nary: at most k children per node
Root: single node with no parent
Leaf: node with no children
Depth: max levels between root and all leaves
Branch: traversal from ancestor node to descendant.
Should be unique for e.g. binary trees (i.e., you cannot reach the same node from two different paths).
Complete tree: Every level is complete, except for maybe the final level. The final level should be filled up from left to right.
Full tree: Every node that is not a leaf has k children.
Perfect tree: all the leave nodes have the same depth (complete + full)
Empty tree: no nodes
Acyclic: doesn't lead back to any given node  
Directed: edges have a direction (parent-child)
